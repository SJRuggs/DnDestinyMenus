Unlike physical shields, energy shields do not require any heavy lifting on your part. They also do not provide any additional AC against attacks, nor do they inherently provide damage resistances. However, whenever you take damage, the damage is applied to your energy shield points first. If your energy shield points are reduced to 0, any further damage (including damage left over from the attack that reduced your shield points to 0) is then applied to your health points. 

Recharging Shields$Certain class features, racial traits, Light abilities, or other sources may allow you to recover lost shield points by making a shield recharge roll. To make a shield recharge roll, you roll a number of dice equal to your Light level (minimum 1), adding the total from your roll to your energy shield points, up to your maximum shield points. You also gain a bonus to your shield recharge roll equal to your Light ability modifier. The size of the dice you use for your recharge roll is stated in your class description.

Overshields$When you gain an overshield, the number of points in your overshield is equal to 5 times your Light level (minimum 5 points). All overshields come with a specified duration. If you run out of overshield points before the duration ends, the duration of the overshield also ends.

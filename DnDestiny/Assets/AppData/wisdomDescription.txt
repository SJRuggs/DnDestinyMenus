Wisdom is a measure of your intuition, your ability to work with nuance, and how well you can understand perspectives other than your own. Wisdom is called for when there is no clear answer, or when the answer can change based on the details of the situation. Your ability to perceive those details is your Wisdom.

Animal Handling$You may need to make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to calm a frightened dog, or to determine what a meowing cat wants from you.

Insight$If you think someone is trying to decieve you, or if you’re trying to predict what someone will do next, your Architect may have you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine how well you read the situation.

Perception$The Wisdom (Perception) skill may be used whenever you’re using your senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste, or touch to learn something, such as where a creature is hiding, or if a secret ingredient is present in a food you’re tasting.




Religion$Wisdom (Religion) checks might be called for if you’re attempting to identify the site of ritual activity, perform a religious ceremony, or identify the practices of a secret cult.

Survival$You may be asked to make a Wisdom (Survival) check if you’re attempting to navigate a raft down a stream, read an old-fashioned map, cook food, or identify safe drinking water.

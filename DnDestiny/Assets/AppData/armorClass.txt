Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear determines your base Armor Class.

Armor Proficiency$Anyone can put on a suit of armor. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast Light abilities.

Heavy Armor$Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the armor has a Strength Requirement, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

Stealth$If the armor has Stealth Disadvantage, the wearer has disadvantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Shields$A shield is carried in one hand, and wearing a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
